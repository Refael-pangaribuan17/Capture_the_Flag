## Forgotten Cipher

The VIC cipher, a Cold War-era encryption, used evolving keys and transformations to secure messages. Inspired by this, the given cipher dynamically modifies its key and applies subtle bitwise transformations to obscure the text.XOR based transforms are used with base key as a single digit and bitwise shifts follow certain index rules.Reversing the process requires careful observationâ€”can you unravel the sequence and restore the original message?
