## Overview

Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are common in the cybersecurity domain, designed to assess participants' skills in various aspects of security, including cryptography, reverse engineering, web security, forensics, and binary exploitation. The goal of this repository is to share solutions and strategies used to solve CTF challenges, providing detailed explanations for each of the techniques employed.

## Available CTF Challenges

The challenges are organized by category or type. Below are the primary categories included in this repository:

1. **Cryptography**
    - Writeups for solving cryptography-related challenges, including symmetric encryption, cipher analysis, and cryptographic protocols.
  
2. **Web**
    - Solutions for web-based challenges, covering topics like web exploitation, security vulnerabilities, and attack vectors in web applications.

3. **Forensics**
    - Writeups focused on challenges involving data recovery, file analysis, and digital forensics techniques for investigating traces left behind by malicious activity.

4. **Reversing**
    - Solutions to challenges that require reverse engineering techniques to analyze and deconstruct binaries or software to uncover hidden information.

5. **PWN (Exploit)**
    - Writeups for challenges focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in systems, often requiring the understanding of buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other exploit techniques.

6. **Miscellaneous**
    - A collection of various challenges that don't fit into the categories above but are still valuable in honing cybersecurity skills.
