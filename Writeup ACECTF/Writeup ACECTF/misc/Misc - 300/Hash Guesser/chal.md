# **Challenge Title: Hash Guesser**

## **Challenge Header**
Welcome to the only cracking challenge of ACECTF1.0, here we have a Hash that we need to crack. The target hash has been taken from a very famous wordlist which has around what 14 million passwords? Yeah, but it's not that simple, the target hash has been `base32 encoded` & then `reversed` before generating the `MD5 hash`. I guess that's enough information for you to start, good luck.
