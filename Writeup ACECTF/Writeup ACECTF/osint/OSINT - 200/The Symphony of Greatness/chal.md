# Challenge Name: The Mysterious Building

## Challenge Description

Hey everyone, myself 'modernlouis'. I remember starting to explore music outside of my native language years ago. Back then, I was just a kid, trying something completely new and unfamiliar. At first, I did it to feel included with others who were effortlessly singing along to the most popular songs of the time.

Over the years, I listened to a lot of artists, but for a long time, I couldn’t settle on an all-time favorite. That changed during the recent pandemic. With all the extra time on my hands, I dove deeper into my love for music. Slowly and without even realizing it, I found myself drawn to a specific kind of sound.

What kind of music, you ask?
Well, not the ones filled with meaningless words just to make rhymes. Not the albums entirely focused on heartbreak stories. And definitely not the tracks made just to curse or diss someone—come on, let’s move past that.

I admire musicians who showcase raw vocal talent, seamlessly blend different genres, and have a a signature sound that was instantly recognizable and highly danceable.

Now, here’s the challenge:
Your task is to figure out which band I’m talking about. The biggest hint?
Me...

Flag Format:
The Flag is the band's name followed by their most streamed song, in this format:
ACECTF{band_name_song_name}

Example:
If the band is One Direction and their most streamed song is Night Changes, then the flag would be:
ACECTF{0n3_d1r3c710n_n16h7_ch4n635}
