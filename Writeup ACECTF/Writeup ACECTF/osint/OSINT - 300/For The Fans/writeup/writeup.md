### **Approach**  

#### **Step 1: Username Investigation**  
We have a username: `DrakeSaltyOVO`. The challenge mentions "Dashboard," which likely means a social media profile. Let's start with Sherlock.  

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop/tmp]
â””â”€$ sherlock DrakeSaltyOVO
```

Sherlock results:  

```
[*] Checking username DrakeSaltyOVO on:
[+] Twitter: https://x.com/DrakeSaltyOVO
[+] mastodon.cloud: https://mastodon.cloud/@DrakeSaltyOVO
[*] Search completed with 2 results
```  

The **Twitter** profile looks promising. Let's check it out.  

#### **Step 2: Twitter Profile Analysis**  

Opening the Twitter profile, we notice a lot of postsâ€”what millennials call `yapping`.

Key observations:  
- **Birthdate:** 14-09-2000  
- **Mentions setting up a blog but couldn't get the desired username**  

Scrolling further, we find another post about their **password**:

- **Password Length:** 7 characters  
- **Type:** All numbers  
- **Crack time:** 1.63 seconds (super weak)  

At this point, we need to find their **blog** username.  

#### **Step 3: Finding the Blog Username**  

If you look closely, their **Twitter name** is:  
**`salty-senpai-drake1`**  

Let's run it through Sherlock to check for blogs.  

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop/tmp]
â””â”€$ sherlock salty-senpai-drake1
```

Sherlock results:  

```
[*] Checking username salty-senpai-drake1 on:
[+] AllMyLinks: https://allmylinks.com/salty-senpai-drake1
[+] Discord: https://discord.com
[+] mastodon.cloud: https://mastodon.cloud/@salty-senpai-drake1
[*] Search completed with 3 results
```

No blogging platforms here. Time for **manual search** or other OSINT tools.  

Checking **Namechk**, we confirm the username exists on **Tumblr**.

#### **Step 4: Checking the Tumblr Blog**  

We find the blog:  
**https://www.tumblr.com/salty-senpai-drake1**  

Scrolling through posts, we spot a **Base64 encoded string** at the bottom.

```  

#### **Step 5: Decoding the Base64 String**  

Using **CyberChef**, we decode the string.  

![7z](Resources/image5.png)  

Turns out, itâ€™s a **7z archive**. Let's save and extract it.  

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop/tmp]
â””â”€$ 7z x download.7z 
```

#### **Step 6: Cracking the 7z Archive Password**  

The archive is **password-protected**.  

Since the user mentioned their **birthdate (14-09-2000)** and we know their password format (**7-digit numeric**), letâ€™s try:  

1. `1492000`  
2. `9142000`  
3. **`2000914`** âœ… (Success!)  

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop/tmp]
â””â”€$ 7z x download.7z
```

Extraction succeeds, revealing multiple files, including **flag.txt**.  

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop/tmp]
â””â”€$ cat flag.txt         
ACECTF{y0u_b3773r_41nt_h4t3}
```
