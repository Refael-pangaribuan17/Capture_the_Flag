# Challenge Name: The Mysterious Building

## Challenge Description

Wow, that's a cool tower—I remember it well; saw it when I was on the metro. But the building on the right... Something about its logo looks familiar, but I just can’t recall its name. 
Can you help me figure out the name of this mysterious building?
