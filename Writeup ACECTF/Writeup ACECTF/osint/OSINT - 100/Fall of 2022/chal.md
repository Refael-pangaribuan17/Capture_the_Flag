# Challenge Name: Fall of 2022

## Challenge Description

It was a peaceful time — schools were over, college admissions were delayed, and COVID was slowly on the decline. It seemed like the perfect time to relax and check my phone for her txts.

The funny thing is, I never got any. So I considered it just another gloomy year.

Anyways, here’s the domain for this CTF: [acectf.tech](https://acectf.tech)

What? You already knew this domain? Oh, I guess you’ll have no trouble finding the flag then.

Good Luck!
