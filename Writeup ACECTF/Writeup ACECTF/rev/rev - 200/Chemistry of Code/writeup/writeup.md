### **Description**

A Rev challenge where we work on security through obfuscation and encodings. Here, we have 2 values Username and password, both these are stored 
in obfuscated Rust code. A simple function when reversed would return the flag, only correct username and password need to be derived and the function
when run with these correct inputs returns the flag itself. Based on the theme of famous show Breaking Bad.


Use solve script - [solve.py](Resources/solve.py)

### **Flag**
