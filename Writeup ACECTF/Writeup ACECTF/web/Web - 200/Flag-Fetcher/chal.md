# Challenge Name: Flag-Fetcher

## Challenge Description
Hey guys, I created a flag fetcher using some web stacks & technologies. It was supposed to fetch the flag.webp image file which contains the flag but there was some kind of error in doing that. Can you verify it? Maybe just get the flag I don't really care if you fix it or not.

[This should've worked](http://34.131.133.224/Flag-Fetcher/)
