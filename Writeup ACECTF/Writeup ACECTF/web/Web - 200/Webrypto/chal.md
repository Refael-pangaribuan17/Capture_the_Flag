## Challenge Description
I think we can all agree that most of us grew up watching the iconic cartoon Tom & Jerry. Every kid would feel that surge of adrenaline during the thrilling chases and chaotic conflicts between the mischievous mouse and the ever-determined cat. The excitement of those scenes—the heart-pounding moments of escape—sometimes felt almost real.

But then, I heard a little rumor: what if all those chases were fake? What if Tom and Jerry were actually friends all along & fought on purpose just to become famous? That revelation shook me. I had no one to ask about this mind-bending twist, so I decided to take matters into my own hands—I created a web app to settle this question once and for all.

I know the truth now. Do you think you can uncover it too?
