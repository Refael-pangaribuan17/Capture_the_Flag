# Challenge Name: Virtual Hard Disk

## Challenge Description

One of the first things I learnt when I started learning to hack was linux.
It was fun until I hit a ceiling of understanding about the differences in Operating Systems, what's a Shell, Kernel, etc.

But once I got better I started developing a liking towards the terminal and how the Linux operating system is `better` than say Windows, or `worse` in some cases.
How none of them is superior, nor the other inferior. We shall find out with this challenge.

Be careful, a lot of fake galfs around.
