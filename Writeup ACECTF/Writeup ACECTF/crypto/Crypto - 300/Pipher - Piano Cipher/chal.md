# Challenge Name: Pipher - Piano Cipher

## Challenge Description
Back in my school days, we were required to pick a "Leisure Time Activity" as part of the curriculum. Four days a week, we had to attend those classes and learn whatever we chose. I opted for the piano—or more specifically, the keyboard.From junior school through high school, I gradually improved. Over time, I moved beyond simply memorizing notes and developed the ability to judge sounds and map notes instinctively, even when hearing a song for the first time. When I discovered this skill, it felt incredible.

But this joy was short-lived. My musical journey ended when I entered high school, as academics took precedence. Later, I pursued my bachelor's degree far from home, leaving my piano behind. It's a decision I've often regretted. Now, all I have are fond, fleeting memories of those starry-eyed days as a kid. In honor of that time, I've created a cipher called the Pipher. There's a bug in it, though—every 6th character of the plaintext leaks. So, yeah, it’s still a work in progress.
