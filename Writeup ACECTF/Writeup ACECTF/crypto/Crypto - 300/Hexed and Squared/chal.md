# Challenge Name: Hexed and Squared

## Challenge Description
While developing these challenges, I kept in mind that some challenges should be made easy for the newbies who're gonna be playing in our CTF.
But, I'm totally against using Base64 and just giving away a flag for free. There's just no learning in that, instead what we're gonna do, 
is that we'll use a custom encoding, where we just have the number 3 due to an entropy collapse. Let's see how good your math is.

Flag Format - ACECTF{.*?}
