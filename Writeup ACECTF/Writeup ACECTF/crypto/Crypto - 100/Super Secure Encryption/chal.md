# Challenge Name: Super Secure Encryption

## Challenge Description

I'm doing a big favour with this one... I'm handing out my super secure functionality to the outer world to stumble upon & explore.
Though, I still remember one of my colleagues once saying that nothing in this world is secure nowadays but my script right here stands on the contrary. I'll give you the access to my arsenal and see if you can prove me wrong.
