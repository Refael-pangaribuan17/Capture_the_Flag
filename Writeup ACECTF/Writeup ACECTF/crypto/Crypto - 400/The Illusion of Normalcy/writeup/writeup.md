## **Challenge Levels**

### **Level I: The Illusion of Normalcy**

#### **Scenario**
Elliot has found an encrypted note on his computer, seemingly simple but hiding a deeper meaning. The hash is encrypted using **MD5**, and the password resonates with themes of his journey.

#### **Hash**
8e45fba5043614adf931a800cb95b45d


#### **Solution**
Players can crack the hash using:
- A wordlist (e.g., those found in Kali Linux)  
- A brute-force MD5 cracker.

**Correct Password:** `eliot@cute`

### **Level II: The Truth About Mr. Robot**

#### **Scenario**
Elliot uncovers a new hash on his father's old computer, tied to clues about Edward Aldersonâ€™s identity. While investigating, he finds old passwords that hint at familial details:

#### **Old Passwords Found**
- `MagdaAlderson123`  
- `Eliot33Alderson1986`  
- `Darlene890Alderson`

#### **Hash**
8388c15caa3de12a162212f786a5d27e13d4bee342080282b66be8e02beca979

*(SHA256)*

#### **Solution**
**Correct Password:** `Alderson43Eliot1995`  
- It references Edward's death date instead of his birthdate, making it harder to guess.

#### **Hints**
- Use tools like **Hashcat** or create a custom dictionary based on:
  - Edward Alderson's DOB, age, name, and last name.
- Filtering the dictionary with common variations can help refine guesses.

### **Level III: The Collapse of Dark Army**

#### **Scenario**
Elliot reaches the heart of the Dark Army's operations. A final encrypted file holds several hashes used by key members. Cracking these is the only way to stop Whiterose and dismantle her plans.

#### **Hash**
SHA512: 51c648c79b59b6f7122bfa1f08f0bbf3282a7e8bce4e394c1da58bb3f57df8f3be0208b0b0ce3cc56f83028b8ba61c1b3f7fae17ffaf44d175f202f0bb1120e6


#### **Solution**
**Correct Password:** `WhiteRoseLovesTime`  
- This reflects a deep reference to Whiterose's obsession with time, a recurring theme in the show.

#### **Hints**
- A note in the file mentions Whiterose's story and hints at **"Township Power Plant"** or **"Time."**
- Players can deduce that **"time"** plays a significant role in her narrative and is key to solving this level.
