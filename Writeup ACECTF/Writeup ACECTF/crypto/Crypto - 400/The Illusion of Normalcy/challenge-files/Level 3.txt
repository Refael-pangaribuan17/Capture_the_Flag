Personal notes of White Rose

I am Whiterose, a name shrouded in mystery, even among those who claim to know me. By the mid-90s, I had risen to power within the Dark Army, building a network that would shape nations and futures. It was in 1995 that I solidified my control by orchestrating the death of E-Corp’s CEO, Lester Moore, in a plane crash. His refusal to cooperate with my interests concerning the Washington Township power plant left me with no other choice. That plant has always been of great importance to me—far more than anyone could understand.

In 1996, I recognized potential in Francis Shaw, a white ten-year-old outcast living in Shanghai. I brought him into the Dark Army, nurturing his talents. Recruitment has always been a calculated effort—no one enters my circle by accident. Over the years, the Dark Army has cultivated a reputation for having no allegiance, hacking for anyone willing to pay the price. Russia, North Korea, Iran—we’ve worked with them all, sowing chaos and dismantling the systems of U.S. capitalism, though my motivations run far deeper than mere rebellion.

Few, if any, within the Dark Army have met me in person. Most believe their leader to be a man, and I am content to let them cling to their illusions. I keep my true self hidden behind Minister Zhi Zhang, the Chinese Minister of State Security. My time is precious, each second accounted for. The watch I wear beeps every minute, a constant reminder that time is my most valuable currency. My schedule is inflexible; rarely do I see anyone more than once. Zhang has no sister, though that lie has served its purpose when needed.

My obsession, my life’s work, lies at the Washington Township power plant. People like Emily Moss and Edward Alderson worked there, unknowingly contributing to my project. Their exposure to the plant’s radiation cost them their lives, a sacrifice I do not take lightly. The details of my project remain known only to me. It is my vision, my purpose, and I will go to any length to protect it. I do not seek approval or understanding; I seek results. Time waits for no one, not even me.

This is who I am. Every action I take is calculated. Every life touched by my choices serves a purpose. And my purpose is far greater than they can imagine.
