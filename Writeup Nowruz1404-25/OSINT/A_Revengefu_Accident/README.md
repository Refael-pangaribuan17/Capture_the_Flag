## Description
We're searching for a fatal aviation accident that occurred before 1990. According to the accident report, a passenger carrying a S&W 29 revolver caused the disaster by shooting at the cabin crew. We need the Accident Number to revisit and revise the investigation.

The aircraft involved in the accident is notable for its unique design:

It features four small engines mounted under high wings, a distinctive T-tail configuration, and a noticeably drooped nose profile. Its compact fuselage belies its four-engine configuration, and it's equipped with a distinctive airbrake system that deploys from the tail cone area. This British-made regional jet was specifically designed for operations at noise-sensitive airports

Flag: `FMCTF{DCA88MA008}`
