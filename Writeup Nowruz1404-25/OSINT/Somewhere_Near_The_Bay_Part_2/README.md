## Description

I didn't think you could do it and honestly, I'm surprised!

That was pure luck, don't you think? Well, if you want to prove otherwise, you can do something crazy.

Can you tell me the legal name of the company that owns the bus in the picture?


Flag: `FMCTF{NATIONAL_PARK_TOURS_AND_TRANSPORT_INC}`

## Solution

1. By zooming on the bus we can see `USDOT 2435195` under its driver's seat
2. Search `"usdot" "2435195"` on Google
3. [This](https://safer.fmcsa.dot.gov/query.asp?query_type=queryCarrierSnapshot&query_param=USDOT&query_string=2435195) listed the information related to the bus and the bus owner
