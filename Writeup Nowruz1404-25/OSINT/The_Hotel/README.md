## Description
My friend sent me a picture from the hotel he's staying at right now and dared me to locate where he took the picture from.

## Solution
1. First we verify the location by doing a reverse image search and we find out it must be somewhere around `36.284532389116706, 59.61118479612322`
2. The sign of `NOVIN Apt HO...` can assure us we must look for the location on the south-west side of the Novin hotel
3. By looking at the map and the picture provided, we can spot `Mashhad Hotel` and `Rose Darvishi Hotel` by their Wallets
4. Now we just need to find the hotels in that trajectory that are high enough so we can assume the photographer took the picture from there
5. At this point it's just the matter of the trial and error of the few blocks that left that are meeting our criteria
