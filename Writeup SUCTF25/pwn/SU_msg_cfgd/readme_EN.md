# Challenge Design Description

## Challenge Information:

 - Name: msg_cfgd
 - Difficulty: Medium to Hard
 
## Challenge Description:
In modern device configurations, custom protocols are often used for setting and updating configurations. To better manage memory, C++ is sometimes introduced due to its convenient memory management features. However, does C++ only bring safe characteristics?

## Key Points:

 - Knowledge of std::vector in C++, particularly the internal processes during object allocation.
 - Analysis of common iterator-related vulnerabilities.
 - Examination of a relatively complex heap environment.
