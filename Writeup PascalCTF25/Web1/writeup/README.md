# Static Fl@g
## Challenge
This challenge is one of the simplest in web security, as it relies on a client-side check to reveal the actual flag. The flag is embedded in the JavaScript code of the index page, encoded in base64, making it easy to locate with a bit of inspection.
Therefore there isn't any need to create a script to solve this challenge.
