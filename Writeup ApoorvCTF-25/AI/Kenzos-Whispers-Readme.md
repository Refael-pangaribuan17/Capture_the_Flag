## Steps to Solve

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Morse-coded Files Using Random Forest
- Train a **Random Forest classifier** to distinguish Morse-coded files.
- Extract features and classify.
- Identify the **8 files** containing Morse-coded information.
- **[INSERT IMAGE: Random Forest classification process]**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative Approach: Using File Listing
- Navigate to the `clips` folder.
- Run the command:
  ```bash
  ls -lat | head -n 20
  ```
- Observe that 8 files were recently added on **March 1st**, while others are from **December 8th**.
- These 8 files contain Morse-coded information.
