## Description
Professor Oak, the renowned Pok√©mon researcher, has developed an advanced Pok√©dex upgrade that utilizes neural networks to classify Pok√©mon types. However, a mishap caused by an overexcited Pikachu has disrupted crucial data files, leaving the system in chaos. Now, trainers must step up to the challenge‚Äîtraining a CNN model to restore order and complete the classifier, ensuring the Pok√©dex can once again identify Pok√©mon with precision.

## Setup Instructions
The whole thing runs in kaggle. So, no worries. The notebook required is in private right now. Once the CTF starts. I'll make it public.

## Misc
- First find the answer for the pdf.
- Access the dataset and notebook
- Find the seed for the global generator
- Build the model and Train
- Answer questions asked by running the test file

## Writeup
üî• Welcome, Pok√©mon Trainer! üî•
Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pok√©mon! üåç‚ö°
I‚Äôm Professor Oak, the leading Pok√©mon researcher, and I‚Äôve been working on an advanced Pok√©dex upgrade that can automatically classify Pok√©mon types using cutting-edge neural networks. This breakthrough could revolutionize how trainers understand their Pok√©mon!
BUT‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs been a slight hiccup in the lab. üò∞
My Pikachu got a little too excited and‚Äîwell, let‚Äôs just say a few crucial data files were shocked into oblivion. ‚ö°üí• Now, the entire system is scrambled, and I need your help to restore order and complete the classifier!
Now.. For further details, access the PDF. Heads up!! It's password protected. The password is the name of the pokemon Ash first captured. Good Luck Trainer !!!
