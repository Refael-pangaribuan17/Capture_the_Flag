## Writeup

We have been given a png file. First thing i do when i get anything like this is run `strings` or `exiftool` or just basic stuff.

Running `exiftool petah.png` we get
```

```

Notice the `Comment : username:buffedpetah`

So i looked online for some guy named petah, just tried different social media accounts.

Found him on github.

![github](./files/writeup_images/github.png)

His README.md seems to be in japanese, so i tried to translate it 
```
üêî Buffed Peta üêî

Hello, my name is Peter Griffin. I'm a student by day and a Fortnite warrior by night. Taste a hamburger that may be a portal to another dimension, and enjoy the strange moments of being at the mercy of life. One time I saw my horse attempt a moonwalk under a double rainbow. I calmly surrender to the cosmic absurdities of everyday life.

If you search my files, you might come across something interesting.

I'm an idiot, but I'm also a genius.
```

Nothing usefull

Next i started looking through his repos, there was only one `freakQuest`

There were only two files, `analyze.py` and `project.obj`

looking at `project.obj` 
```

```
![dtmf](./files/writeup_images/dtmf.png)

these are just vertices no mesh, so opening in a 3d viewer wouldnt help, so i started searching online on what these values could be, then i found first two values represent the low-high frequescies of dtmf tones

but we still need to figure out what he 3rd value is, looking at the patter the 3rd values are like 100, 200, 300, 400, ...

so i figured they are time, So sorted these values based on the 3rd value use dtmf table for the 1st and 2nd values and got this

```
2*7*666*666*777*888*222*8*333*#*7*33*8*2*44*#*8*44*33*#*44*666*7777*777*7777*33*#*444*7777*#*44*33*2*#*22*8*9*#
```

These lookes like those old dialpad way of typing,

![dialpad](./files/writeup_images/dialpad.jpg)

substituting with this and using * as delimers we get

```
APOORVCTF#PETAH#THE#HOSRSE#IS#HEA#BTW
```

substituting # we get
```
APOORVCTF{PETAH_THE_HOSRSE_IS_HEA_BTW}
```
